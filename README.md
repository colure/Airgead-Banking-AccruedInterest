# Cplusplus-Program

This project solved the problem of creating an application that allowed the user to view the results of and differences between establishing an account and the values as they built up over time. 
I was able to create a clean visual for the user to be able to compare the results, with code that was readable and well noted. I broke up parts of the code in to modular parts as well.
I would enhance by code by combing it and looking for areas that could be further simplified. For example, I still feel there is a significant amount of code in the body of the function. I could have also broken parts of the code up further so that maybe not all the long codes for the function were all in one file. It would make it cleaner and operate more efficiently, reducing redundancies and improving readability.
I struggled for a while to find one part of the code that was messing up the rest of it. A simple typo was preventing the program from running and neither myself nor the errors printed seemed to be able to figure out where it was coming from. It took a while, but it finally clicked after poring over other examples to see there was a parenthesis missing...
Effective organization of data and parsing information to and from variables using structures will be helpful. I enjoyed working with structures, probably because they gave me so much trouble at first.
I made this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable by including notes for each part of the code. I also broke up any part of the code that I could into individual functions that could be recalled and reused.
